            <h3>Smart Car Parking System</h3>
            <p>In this project, I developed a Smart Car Parking System aimed at optimizing parking management in busy urban areas. The system uses sensors to detect available parking spaces in real time, transmitting the data to a central system, which then guides drivers to the nearest vacant spot. The project integrates IoT technology with a user-friendly web application to provide a seamless experience for both parking lot operators and users.

            <h3>Image Classification</h3>
            <p>In this project, I developed an Image Classification system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify images into various categories. CNNs, a deep learning architecture, are highly effective in recognizing patterns in images such as edges, textures, and shapes. The project involved training a CNN model on a large dataset, where it learned to identify and distinguish between objects across different image classes.
